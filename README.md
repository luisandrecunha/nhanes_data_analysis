*  Prepare your dataset (e.g., to avoid overfitting)  
*  Fit you logistic regression, random forest, and gbm models to predict DIQ010  
*  Tune your models to optimize performance    
*  Show and *explain* your results, use plots where appropriate  
*  Evaluate comparative model performance  
*  State your conclusions
